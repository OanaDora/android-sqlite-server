<p>
These classes were copied from aosp's frameworks/base at android-4.2.2_r1 for
the purposes of backward and forward compatibility.  These are internal,
private classes but that themselves do not depend on private APIs.  Copying
them here, unfortunately, adds the burden of maintenance/merging on us.
